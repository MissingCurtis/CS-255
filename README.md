<li>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</li>
<p>The client DrivPass envisioned a online component to driver training allowing the student to access study material and online test. It would also provided easier scheduling and review of drive session. Employee's of DrivePass would have access to the system limited by their postion's requirement. The system was designed to be cloud based and allow for minimum maintanance by the IT department. </p>
<li>What did you do particularly well?</li>
<p>I think my package access and purchase system was a decent design. Choices flowed into the next and provided good accessabilty. I also think my overall sytem design was fairly complete, it covered almost all functionality required by the DrivePass client.</p>
<li>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</li>
<p>If I was going to revise anything I would revise the DMV operations. I don't think I fleshed out its functions well enough. DrivePass want to get updates and I never added a database to hold te updates and interact with the IT department to implement the updates.</p>
<li>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</li>
<p>DrivePass wanted segregated access for its employees and I emplemented diffrent levels of access in the system. I think that if you are being payed to do a job it is important to try and fulfil the requests of your customer. </p>
<li>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</li>
<p>System design for me requires being a balance of wants and needs. Your client and thier customers will have what they wants that may not match. So your job is to find what they need. First you gather requirements, then you start doing interviews after comes incremental design and testing.</p>
